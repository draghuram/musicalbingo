- Play youtube videos in silent mode and ask people to guess.

- Play middle of the song and ask them to guess.

- Play instrumental version and ask them to guess.

- Compile information about each song and ask trivia questions or talk
  about the details.

- Select theme based songs.

- Generate chits with background image. Or otherwise, brand the
  chits. Provide info such as phone numbers and contact details.

- Each chit can have unique ID with which the program that runs the
  game can quickly identify if any row/columns are full.

- We can generate chits with known overlaps. For example, we can
  generate in such a way that no two chits have no column with same
  songs. Similarly, for the whole chit.

- Develop a Python UI that runs locally to run the game.

- Charging for chits

  - We can use a system like Venmo to transfer money for chits as well
    as for sending gifts. Amazon gift cards might work as well.
